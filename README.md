# FreezeApp

We all have many apps on our phone which we need occasionally, but we cannot uninstall them. This App has the solution.

Any System or Installed App can be Disabled by sending them into hibernation mode. The App will be removed from app menu but could be enabled when needed. All services/notifications/broadcasts/etc won't work in disable mode. (So what we get is more precious RAM)

It's a personal project created to speed up my Rooted Moto X 1st gen 2013. There are many similar(better) apps in the market. But being an Android Dev, I thought of doing some hours of work myself.
